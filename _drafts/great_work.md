title: On doing great work
---

- There are three ingredients in great work:
    - Natural ability
    - Practice
    - Effort
- You can do pretty well with just two, but to do the best work you need all three
- It's easy to work hard if you have clearly defined, externally imposed goals. What's difficult is to work hard towards goals that are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed
