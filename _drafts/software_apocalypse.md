title: The Software Apocalypse
---

- We used to be able to exhaustively test electromechanical systems. Software is different, its flexibility is both software's miracle and curse
- Because software can be changed rapidly and cheaply, it's in a state of constant flux. And because it's unmoored from anything physical, a program that's 1000 times more complex than another one takes up the same space, it tends to grow without bounds
- We are attempting to build systems that are beyond our ability to intellectually manage them
- Our standard framework for engineering failures was not developed for software
- Software doesn't break, it simply does what it's told
- Complexity is invisible to the eye
- What is it about code that makes it so complex for the human mind?
