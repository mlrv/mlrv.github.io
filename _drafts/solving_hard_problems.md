title: Solving hard problems
---

- You don't have to solve all big problems at once. If you try, you'll get crushed and won't get anything done
- Be deliberate about which problems we are attacking seriously right now VS which ones we are doing something that's good enough for now
- The more time you spend working in this "approximation space", the better you become (more context and more skills)
