title: Data models and query languages
---

Data models not only inform the way software is written, they also shape the way we think about a problem.

Most systems are built by layering data models on top of one another, each layer abstracting away the complexity of what is below (e.g, _objects < json < bytes < hardware_).

When the relational model was invented, it came with a new way of querying data, SQL, a declarative query language.
