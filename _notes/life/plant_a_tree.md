title: The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is now
---

While the past is full of missed opportunities, the present offers us a chance to take meaningful steps towards a better future. This digital garden embraces the very same idea, where the cultivation of ideas and the nurturing of knowledge are ongoing processes. Just as a tree planted today will take time to grow, each note is a growing, living entity that contributes to a larger ecosystem of thought.

We can't change the past, but we have to power and the responsibility to shape our future through the actions we take today.
