title: Data systems
---

Martin Kleppmann uses _Data systems_ as an umbrella term to describe databases, queues, and all those kind of software systems that have to do with data, either in transit or at rest.

Many applications today are data-intensive rather than compute intensive, and we'd like them to be [[Reliable data systems|_reliable_]], [[Scalable data systems|_scalable_]], and [[Maintainable data systems|_maintainable_]].

The general idea is to design these systems not with the goal to prevent faults or errors, but to tolerate them.
