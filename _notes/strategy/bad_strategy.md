title: Bad strategy is not simply the absence of good strategy
---

There are three major components to bad strategy:

- [[Fluff]]. Exotic and complex words used to give the illusion of high level thinking
- Failure to face the challenge. It's impossible to improve a situation if you can't even define the challenge you are facing
- Mistaking goals for strategy. A series of goals can be useful to define where you want to go, but they are not enough if you don't know how to get there
