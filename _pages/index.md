Hey, I'm Marco ðŸ‘‹

You found my digital garden, feel free to have a look around and explore. The main purpose of this place is to create the right conditions for ideas to develop, grow, and form connections across disciplines.

At the end of each note, you'll find a series of backlinks, pointing to all the notes connected to the one you are reading.

These notes are not meant to be static. They exist with the very purpose to evolve, change, and form new connections over time. They are usually referred to as [[Evergreen notes]].

Ultimately, the end goal of creative research is to be able to connect the dots and get a sense of the bigger picture. This is my attempt at doing so.

If you're curious about the values and ideas that shape my decisions, you can check out my [[Guiding Principles|guiding principles]].


Finally, here's a list of [[all|all notes]].
